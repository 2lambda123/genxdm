You must install Maven 2.

You must have at least J2SE 1.6.

You should be familiar with Maven's "goals" and usage.  As this is a
multi-module project, "mvn compile" will not work.  "mvn install" is the
"standard" command for builds.  If tests have broken, try
"mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true".

For the IDE, if you're using Eclipse, Eclipse 3.7 minimum is required. Install
Maven2Eclipse (m2e) from the Eclipse repository. Also install Bndtools;
instructions for doing so are here: http://bndtools.org/installation.html .
You want subversive as well, in all likelihood (the Eclipse subversion
plugin found in the Eclipse repository).

Bndtools must be configured before you can import the maven projects. See
the section "Contributors" in the Wiki for details.

If you are using something that isn't Eclipse, dunno. If you work it out,
share what you've done on the mailing list.
