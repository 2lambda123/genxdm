The following concrete classes exist in the GenXDM API package.
We can, in theory, test concrete classes (but cannot reasonably
claim to have tested interfaces by implementing them; that's fatuous).

Items with "]]" have complete test cases, in Junit 4.
Items with "--" have issues that currently make things difficult.
Items with "**" still need attention.

org.genxdm package:
DtdAttributeKind: an enumeration without behavior
EventKind: an enumeration without behavior
Feature: an interface
]]NodeKind: enumeration with behavior; test case exists
Resolved: concrete, but parameterized class; its only contract is that
	its members are not null, which is guaranteed in the constructor
Resolver: interface

org.genxdm.axes package: all interfaces
org.genxdm.base package: all interfaces
org.genxdm.base.io package: all interfaces
org.genxdm.base.mutable package: all interfaces

org.genxdm.compat package:
DomCompatibility: concrete utility/helper class; it can only be tested
	with an implementation of a bridge.  Should be part of bridgetest suite.

org.genxdm.exceptions package:
Testing of exceptions is problematic.  We're going to defer it for the time
	being.  We used to have some internationalization test cases, but the
	test cases were unfortunately broken.  Note that there are two enums for
	which we ought to have coverage, but they're ... well, odd.
]]SpillagePolicy: an enumeration with behavior

org.genxdm.names package: all interfaces except
]]NameSource: we have a test (the class has been simplified, as well; it needs further simplification and then to be moved)

org.genxdm.nodes: all interfaces
org.genxdm.typed: all interfaces
org.genxdm.typed.io: all interfaces

org.genxdm.typed.types: all interfaces except:
Emulation: an enumeration with behavior; it relies upon the definition of "A" and can only be
  adequately tested with a (typed) bridge.  put test in bridgetest.
--Quantifier: an enumeration with behavior; test case exists (see issue for Quantifier versus KeeneQuantifier in xs.enums)
VariantKind: an enumeration without behavior

org.genxdm.xs and child packages: need more investigation.  Several cases needed.
	rough outline follows. 

**org.genxdm.xs.constraint.NamespaceConstraint
**org.genxdm.xs.constraint.ValueConstraint

org.genxdm.xs.enums: most have no testable behavior, except:
**DerivationMethod
--KeeneQuantifier (see Quantifier note, above, and issue in tracker)
**WhiteSpacePolicy

(we really don't want to build test cases for exceptions, do we?)
org.genxdm.xs.exceptions.*, except SchemaExceptionThrower and SchemaExceptionHandler

**org.genxdm.xs.SchemaLoadOptions

**org.genxdm.xs.types.UberTypeArgumentOrSelfItera{tor,ble}
]]org.genxdm.xs.types.NativeType
