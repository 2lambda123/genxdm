You must install Maven 2.

You must have at least 1.5 JDK.

You should be familiar with Maven's "goals" and usage.  As this is a
multi-module project, "mvn compile" will not work.  "mvn install" is the
"standard" command for builds.  If tests have broken, try
"mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true".

For Eclipse integration, you must install Maven2Eclipse:
