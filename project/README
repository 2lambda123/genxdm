The project will now fail (at least on my machine) if JAVA_HOME is not set.
This is because JDK 1.8 decided that XHTML is not to be supported.

The pom got updated to include some javadoc-related stuff (it may die if you
try to build with 1.7, too, in which case say something, I guess, and maybe
I'll fix it, in my copious free time) (patches welcome as always).

For 1.8, on OS X, say:

JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) mvn [targets]

Works for me.
