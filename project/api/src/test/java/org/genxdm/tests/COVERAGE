The following concrete classes exist in the GenXDM API package.
We can, in theory, test concrete classes (but cannot reasonably
claim to have tested interfaces by implementing them; that's fatuous).

org.genxdm package:
DtdAttributeKind: an enumeration without behavior
EventKind: an enumeration without behavior
Feature: an interface
NodeKind: enumeration with behavior; test case exists
Resolved: concrete, but parameterized class; its only contract is that
	its members are not null, which is guaranteed in the constructor
Resolver: interface

org.genxdm.axes package: all interfaces
org.genxdm.base package: all interfaces
org.genxdm.base.io package: all interfaces
org.genxdm.base.mutable package: all interfaces

org.genxdm.compat package:
DomCompatibility: concrete utility/helper class; it can only be tested
	with an implementation of a bridge.  Should be part of bridgetest suite.

org.genxdm.exceptions package:
Testing of exceptions is problematic.  We're going to defer it for the time
	being.  We used to have some internationalization test cases, but the
	test cases were unfortunately broken.  Note that there are two enums for
	which we ought to have coverage, but they're ... well, odd.
AssertMessage: an enumeration with behavior; we should test its behavior.
SpillagePolicy: an enumeration with behavior; we should test its behavior.

org.genxdm.names package: all interfaces except
NameSource: we have a placeholder for tests, with an outline

org.genxdm.nodes: all interfaces
org.genxdm.typed: all interfaces
org.genxdm.typed.io: all interfaces

org.genxdm.typed.types: all interfaces except:
Emulation: an enumeration with behavior; we should test its behavior.
Quantifier: an enumeration with behavior; test case exists
VariantKind: an enumeration without behavior

org.genxdm.xs and child packages: need more investigation.
	rough outline follows. 

org.genxdm.xs.constraint.NamespaceConstraint
org.genxdm.xs.constraint.ValueConstraint

org.genxdm.xs.exceptions.*, except SchemaExceptionThrower and SchemaExceptionHandler

org.genxdm.xs.SchemaLoadOptions

org.genxdm.xs.types.UberTypeArgumentOrSelfItera{tor,ble}
