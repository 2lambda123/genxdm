GenXDM enables applications to write code that uses and manipulates XML trees
without being tied to a particular XML tree representation like DOM, DOM4J,
AXIOM, or any other. It also prods developers towards an immutable view of XML
trees, which will make it easier and faster to work with XML across multiple
cores and multiple processors.

GenXDM adds support for critical new XML specifications. Specifically, GenXDM
supports the XQuery Data Model, the foundation of XQuery 1.0, XPath 2.0, and
XSLT 2.0, and an area of active specification development at W3C.
