= Overview =

We don't want to be too religious about our coding conventions, but we do have a few we need to establish.

Like many guidelines, these are very much aspirational, rather than being strictly followed everywhere.

= Additive =

 * Every non-anonymous class has a Javadoc description
 * Every public method in an interface has Javadoc, and every abstract class method has Javadoc
 * Every package gets javadoc description

= Conforming =
 * Use spaces instead of tabs

= Unwanted =
 * No `@author` tags
 * No empty `catch` blocks (at least comment why there's no code!)
