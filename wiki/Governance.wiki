= Voting =

We follow Apache rules for voting. For any given topic, you can vote +1, 0, or -1. At least three fifths of existing committers must approve positively (+1), with no vetoes (-1). Approval (+1) and abstention (0) votes require no explanation. Vetoes (-1) votes must be accompanied by an explanation, and that explanation should indicate how the candidate might work to avoid a future veto (however, a veto ends the vote; a new vote must be proposed).
