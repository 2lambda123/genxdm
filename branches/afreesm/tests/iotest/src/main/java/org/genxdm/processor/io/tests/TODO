Okay, we want to do full contract-based testing.

We probably ought to delay until we have the XQuery Serialization
questions worked through.

Test the contract for parsing.

Test the contract for writing.

Test the contracts for setting up one's own preferred resolver
and reporter, and for setting up any other configuration information.

Stuff like that.
