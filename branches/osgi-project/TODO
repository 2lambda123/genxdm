this is kinda like an issues list for the branch:

1) change the artifact ids. they can't have dashes in.
    genxdm-api -> api
    genxdm-xpath-api -> xpath.v10
    bridgekit -> no change
    bridgetest -> no change
    bridge-xyzzy -> bridge.xyzzy
    iotest -> processor.io.tests
    proc-convert -> processor.convert
    proc-io -> processor.io
    proc-w3cxs -> processor.w3c.xs
    proc-w3cxs-val -> processor.w3c.xs.validation
    proc-xpath -> processor.xpath.v10
    valtest -> processor.w3c.xs.validationtest
    xpathtest -> processor.xpath.v10.tests
2) figure out how to make the generated jar files use the
   groupId.artifactId-version pattern.
3) based on some of the weird names shown above, consider renaming packages
   for consistency, and then making the artifactIds match.
